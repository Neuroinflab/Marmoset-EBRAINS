At that stage we were very much in the process of learning how to process marmoset brain tissue, so the histology was...sub-optimal. There are no Nissls available, and an attempt at a gold chloride myelin stain (sections illustrated) is all that remained.
The cell plots in this case were performed manually using a camera lucida. Some of the original pencil plots are shown (sections m16a-16g). 
The registration to a template in this case was based on the brain external morphology only, since the histology was not compatible with the pipeline described by Majka et al. (2016; J Comp Neurol 524:2161–2181). Nonetheless, assignment of cells in the cortex to areas correlates very well with manual expert assessment, so the flat maps presented appear accurate.
